# Face-Swap Deepfake Detection using AI/ML

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an **AI/ML-based solution to detect face-swap deepfake videos** effectively. The system leverages **CNN-GRU-LSTM architectures** combined with **Grad-CAM and SHAP explainability techniques** to achieve robust detection performance with model interpretability.

##  Key Features

- **Face-swap deepfake detection** with high accuracy
- Hybrid **CNN-GRU-LSTM model architecture**
- **Grad-CAM and SHAP** integrated for explainable AI
- Processes **75,000+ video frames** using MTCNN and MediaPipe FaceMesh for facial alignment
- **Real-time detection app** built with Streamlit supporting video and webcam input
